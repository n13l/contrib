## OpenVPN
### Added support for TLS Keying Material Exporters
Keying Material Exporter [RFC-5705] allow additional keying material to be
derived from existing TLS channel. This exported keying material can then be
used for a variety of purposes. TLS allows client and server to establish
keying material for use in the upper layers between the TLS end-points and
channel bindings is straightforward and well-defined mechanism how to
authenticate other layers.
